## What We Didn't Implement (and Why)

### ‚ùå Missing ERC Judge-Provided Features

**Basic Fallback Firmware:**
- **What We're Missing**: The ERC judges' naive 4-quadrant, 0.5s per frame reference implementation
- **Why We Didn't Implement**: We focused on optimized solutions rather than baseline compatibility
- **Impact**: We have no fallback option if our optimized protocol fails during Challenge 2

**Backup Password System:**
- **What We're Missing**: QR code/OCR reading for the printed backup password mentioned in ERC specs
- **Why We Didn't Implement**: We focused our resources on primary optical transmission
- **Impact**: We have no backup if LED transmission completely fails during the competition

### ‚ùå Competition-Specific Integrations

**Robot Navigation Integration:**
- **What We're Missing**: Autonomous navigation to/from equipment panel for our ERC robot
- **Why We Didn't Implement**: This was likely part of other Challenge 2 sub-tasks
- **Impact**: We'll need manual robot positioning during the competition

**Multi-Attempt Strategy:**
- **What We're Missing**: Protocol for handling multiple password attempts within ERC time limits
- **Why We Didn't Implement**: Single-boot limitation makes this complex
- **Impact**: We have limited retry capability during Challenge 2

## Conclusion

Our Team Interplanetar implementation demonstrates excellent technical capability and addresses the core Challenge 2 requirements effectively. We've built a sophisticated system that goes beyond the basic ERC requirements with optimized encoding, robust error detection, and adaptive parameters.

The main gaps we face are in ERC competition-specific integrations (backup systems, robot navigation) and comprehensive real-world testing. Our next focus should be on validation under actual competition conditions and implementing the backup systems to ensure mission success even if our primary optical transmission encounters issues during Challenge 2.

Our technical foundation is solid‚Äînow it's about hardening the system for the unpredictable real-world ERC Remote 2025 competition environment.
